```

### 3. Deploy Sui Contract

No need to start Sui - devnet is public and always running.

### 4. Configure MetaMask

**Add Custom Network for Anvil Localhost:**
1. Open MetaMask extension
2. Click network dropdown at top (usually says "Ethereum Mainnet")
3. Click "Add network" or "Add network manually"
4. Fill in the following details:
   - Network Name: Anvil Localhost
   - New RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
   - Chain ID: 31337
   - Currency Symbol: ETH
5. Click "Save"
6. Switch to "Anvil Localhost" network

**Import Test Account:**
1. Click account icon (top right)
2. Click "Import Account"
3. Select "Private Key"
4. Paste: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
5. Click "Import"
6. Account should show ~10000 ETH balance

**Import IBT Token:**

### 5. Configure Sui Wallet

**Switch to Devnet:**
1. Open Sui Wallet extension
2. Click settings icon (gear icon, usually top right)
3. Click "Network"
4. Select "Devnet" from the list
5. Close settings

**Verify/Import Account:**
1. If you already have a Sui wallet, verify your address matches:
   - Expected: 0x1476da5ccef9917f4ecd4a7494522154f82bb231fab974e81a20fad8e5938b0e
2. If you need to import:
   - Click account menu
   - Select "Import Private Key" or "Import Passphrase"
   - Enter your Sui CLI wallet passphrase or private key
   - Confirm import

**Get Devnet SUI (Gas):**

You need SUI tokens to pay for transaction fees (gas) on the Sui blockchain. Since we're using devnet (test network), you can get free test SUI:

1. Open your Sui wallet and copy your address
2. Go to https://discord.com/invite/sui
3. Join Sui Discord server
4. Go to #devnet-faucet channel
5. Type: !faucet YOUR_SUI_ADDRESS
6. Wait for confirmation - you'll receive devnet SUI for gas fees

Note: You need gas to execute any transaction on Sui (minting, burning, transferring). Without SUI for gas, the bridge won't work.

### 6. Start Web Application

```bash
cd .../bridge-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open: http://localhost:3000/

## Usage

1. Connect both wallets
2. Select transfer direction
3. Enter amount
4. Click Bridge Tokens
5. Confirm transactions

## Restart After Reboot

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd .../ethereum-contract
anvil

# Terminal 2
cd .../ethereum-contract
./deploy.sh

# Terminal 3
cd .../bridge-app
npm run dev
```

Sui devnet does not need restarting.
(Sui)
You ONLY need to run deploy.sh when:
First time setup
You want to deploy a new/updated contract
The contract addresses in App.jsx are missing or wrong



## Technical Details

- Ethereum: ERC20 token with 18 decimals on localhost (Anvil)
- Sui: Coin standard with 9 decimals on devnet
- Bridge automatically converts between decimal formats
